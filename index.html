				<h2> About Myself </h2>
				<p> I am Alex Carron, a first year at RIT majoring in Software Engineering. I went to Lindbergh High School in St Louis, Missouri. I host online game shows on Discord and post what happens in them on my youtube channel, LL Game Shows! I also like listening to music, watching YouTube, rhythm games, and party games. I've also recently started getting into anime. I'm introverted and very low energy, so I prefer quiet, intimate atmosphers with low-pressure activities.</p>

				<h2> My Favorite Food </h2>
